Starting with the exclusive grant of the state-owned gambling club in Maameltaine (known as Casino Du Liban), this article will address the impact of the Lebanese Competition Law 281/2022, which was issued as part of a general governmental </span><a href="https://www.economy.gov.lb/public/uploads/files/8404_8262_8333.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">policy</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, on this exclusive grant and its renewal.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h3 class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gambling as an Exclusive Grant in Light of the Lebanese Competition Law&nbsp;</span></h3><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Lebanese Competition Law 281/2024 has marked a pivotal step in regulating antitrust practices in Lebanon, a market that was for long known for the economic concentration of major sectors with a handful of business taycoons. With the renewal of Casino Du Liban's license coming up in 2026, the question of monopolistic practices and its potential conflict with the Lebanese Competition Law is expected to surface soon and could turn into a public opinion issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h3 class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Competition Law 281/2022 &amp; Conflict With Other Enforceable Laws&nbsp;</span></h3><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Article 65 of the Competition Law cancelled all laws relating to exclusivity and competition that are inconsistent therewith, mainly those relating to the law decree number 73/83 of September 9, 1983 (possession and trading of goods and commodities). Article 65 further presents that in case of conflict between the Competition Law and the laws of regulated economic functions, the provision of the Competition Law shall apply in relation to any matter relating to any breach thereof.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h3 class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Impact Of The Lebanese Competition Law 281/22 on Gambling Monopoly</span></h3><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The introduction of the Competition Law 281/2024, has posed questions in connection to the application of the laws regulating exclusivity of certain economic functions such as gambling. With the exclusive grant of Casino Du Liban due for renewal in 2026, this issue will surface to public debate especially after the nonbinding </span><a href="https://lebpress.com/%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%85-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%88-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%B6/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">opinion </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">made by the Audit Bureau in relation to Casino Du Liban?s exclusive grant extending to online gambling under the current exclusivity grant.

Further, the Competition Law (Article 9/First) provides that it is prohibited for anyone who holds a Dominant Market Position in a market, whether a natural or legal Person, or a group of Persons, to abuse this position in a way that leads to disrupting, limiting, or preventing competition in the relevant market. One example of Dominant market position is what was presented in Article 9/Second further provides that a Person is considered to be in a market Dominant Position, whether as a supplier or a buyer of a specific type of goods or commercial services, if its share in the relevant market is at least 35%. It is worth noting that the presence of small gambling businesses in Lebanon does not dismiss the application of the Competition Law for lack of exclusivity/dominance, as the licenses granted for certain small ?gambling" centers, was issued by virtue of Decision 142 of the Ministry of Interior Affairs which explicitly excludes the gambling activities under law of August 4, 1954 regulating Casino Du Liban.&nbsp;It is worth noting that the presence of other gambling businesses in Lebanon does not dismiss the application of the Competition Law for lack of exclusivity, as the licenses granted for certain small gambling centers, was issued by virtue of Decision 142 of the Ministry of Interior Affairs which explicitly excludes the gambling activities under law of August 4, 1954 regulating Casino Du Liban.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h3 class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Abuse Of Dominant Market Position</span></h3><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Article 9/Third of the Competition Law states that a Person is considered to be acting in abuse of its Dominant Market Position if it engages in or participates in actions that lead to the disruption, limitation, or prevention of competition is considered to be abusing their position, including, for example:</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hindering the entry of others into the market, excluding them, or exposing them to significant losses, including selling below cost, setting prices or terms for resale of goods or services, or imposing such terms unilaterally.</span></li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To answer the question of whether the state and/or Casino Du Liban or either of them is/are Person(s) is acting in abuse of its/their Dominant Market Position and consequently acting in breach of the Lebanese Competition Law, four questions need to be addressed:</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Does the state and/or Casino Du Liban satisfy the definition of a ?Person? under the Competition Law?</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Do they (or either of them) satisfy the Dominant Market Position criterion?&nbsp;</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Are they both or either of them abusing that Dominant Position? and</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Is there a legal ground to dismiss the application of Competition Law and if so what are the legal basis to that, how constitutional and enforceable that is?</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Will the gambling industry and likely other exclusive economic functions continue to benefit from this long established practice or will such exclusive economic functions come to an end? Will the monopoly scene in Lebanon change bringing an end to the gambling monopoly and other exclusive economic functions. To achieve that a competent body has to conclude that the criterion for abuse of Dominant Market Position is satisfied under the provisions of the Lebanese Competition law, and which Person/entity is hindering the entry of others into the gambling market or excluding them? Is it Casino Du Liban, the state or both? And how would the Competition Law apply to each of those two scenarios?&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What is evident is that there are legitimate questions to pose regarding the exclusivity of Casino Du Liban, a subject that will ultimately and probably soon surface to public debate as one of the politically and economically charged topics.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Next publishing: </span><a href="https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/lebanon-country-profile/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tobacco Manufacturing and Distribution as an Exclusive Grant </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">in Light of the Lebanese Competition Law.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Author: </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fadi-el-jurdi-31984747/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Fadi El Jurdi</a></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">M</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">anaging Partner</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?
