In a </span><a href="https://padel-magazine.co.uk/viviana-corcuera-hubby-is-the-inventor-of-padel/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">report </a><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">by the World Padel Tour, Viviane was quoted saying she found it a tedious but pleasurable job asking her husband details such as the court measurements and lines, etc. It wasn?t until three decades later that the </span><a href="https://www.padelfip.com/history/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">game rules were unified and the game was officially called Padel</a><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It is no wonder that this game known as the "sport that brings people together" is becoming more popular among the Lebanese. In 2020, the </span><a href="https://lpf.com.lb/about" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Lebanese Padel Federation </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">was established and took on duties such as overseeing and promoting all aspects of the Padel in Lebanon. Local clubs that aspire to participate in official local and international competitions are required to be registered with the Federation. These clubs should hold the Federation?s </span><a href="https://lpf.com.lb/club-license?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Padel license</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to insure their adherence to the sport?s standards and rules.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The legal nature of sports clubs in Lebanon</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sports clubs in Lebanon function as non-profit organizations charged by the Lebanese law to provide care for the youth and fill their free time with cultural, social, civil, physical and sports activities (art. 17 law 629, 2004). This </span><a href="http://www.minijes.gov.lb/Programs/Law/%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%85-629-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%A9" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">law </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">that established the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Lebanon in 2004, required all sports? clubs operating on the Lebanese territories to be licensed by a ministerial decision signed by the Minister of Youth and Sports in person.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Establishing a sports organisation or local club in Lebanon is regulated by </span><a href="http://77.42.251.205/Law.aspx?lawId=268653" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">decree 4482, 2016</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. The procedure is quite similar to that of establishing any non-profit organization. It mainly requires (art.9):</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">The selection of the founding members to serve for a period of maximum 2 years during which they run the initial work.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">A charter or statutes that includes all information such as the organization?s name and address, its objectives, the membership details, the duties of the general assembly and its meetings, the administrative committee and its election procedure, and the financial status of the organization.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The sports organization should submit a license application to the Ministry of Youth and Sports including the above and a list of supporting documents as per article 10 of the decree. The additional documents are mainly details of the sports club site, including but not limited to the maps of the courts and the rental agreements or real-estate ownership deeds.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the law, the Ministry should take no longer than one month to verify that the organisation meets all administrative and technical requirements. Afterwards the application will be forwarded to the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities for opinion within a period of two months. Then the license decision will be issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While still a rising sport on the national level, Padel clubs are operating under the non-profit organisations model. While for example the Lebanese football premier league clubs are taking a more commercial approach in terms of revenue generation, particularly sponsorship deals and commercial partnerships which allows them to invest heavier in promoting the game. In all cases organizations or clubs should apply for a tax identification number at the Ministry of Finance, and endorse required procedures to adhere to Lebanese tax and financial status requirements.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Future of the Padel model</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It will be interesting to see how fast will Padel continue to grow in Lebanon and how popular it will become. This will definitely determine whether it will shift into a more commercial approach or will remain to function as non-profit. The main challenge of the current status is the sport's ability to seek support and increase revenue to speed up growth. Yet adhering to the main purpose of community engagement and youth development has so far proven successful for this sport in particular. In addition, maintaining compliance with legal requirements and financial regulations is certainly important for the long term success of Padel and its people in Lebanon. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
