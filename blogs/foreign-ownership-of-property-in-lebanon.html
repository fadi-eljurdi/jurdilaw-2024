The foundational legal document is Decree No. 11614 (January 4, 1969), which has been amended by subsequent laws, most notably Law No. 296 (April 3, 2001). These laws set strict conditions and limits for property ownership by foreigners, reflecting Lebanon?s commitment to sovereignty and constitutional provisions against settlement.&nbsp;</span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, what are </strong><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Key Provisions for Non-Lebanese Property Ownership </strong><strong>&amp;#x203D;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">1. Licensing Requirement</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Non-Lebanese individuals or entities must obtain a license from the Lebanese Council of Ministers before acquiring any real property rights. This includes ownership of land or property designated for construction. Licenses are granted upon the proposal of the Minister of Finance and are subject to specific conditions outlined by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="background-color: transparent;">2.Prohibited Transactions</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The law prohibits property acquisitions by:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Individuals without nationality from a recognized state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Acquisitions that contravene Lebanon?s constitutional ban on settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">3.Ownership Limits&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Non-Lebanese ownership is by Law capped at:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">3%   of the total land area in Lebanon.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">10% of the total land area in Beirut Governorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The ownership percentages mentioned above include Lebanese companies considered equivalent to non-Lebanese under Article 2 of the law enacted by Decree No. 11614 dated 4/1/1969, with the following exceptions:</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">First: Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> where the majority of shares (more than 50%) are owned by natural Lebanese partners or purely Lebanese companies, provided their bylaws prohibit the transfer of these shares to non-Lebanese persons. In such cases, only 50% of the areas owned by these companies are calculated within the percentages mentioned in this article.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Second: Joint Stock Companies or Partnerships Limited by Stocks</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> where the majority of stocks (more than 50%) are owned by natural Lebanese persons or purely Lebanese companies, provided their statutes prohibit the transfer of these shares to non-Lebanese persons. In such cases, only 50% of the areas owned by these companies are calculated within the percentages mentioned in this article.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The attainment of the ownership percentages will be announced by a decree adopted by the Council of Ministers upon the proposal of the Minister of Finance. The acquisition of real property rights by non-Lebanese persons, or those deemed equivalent to non-Lebanese under Article 2 of the law enacted by Decree No. 11614 dated 4/1/1969, will be suspended unless such acquisitions occur between non-Lebanese persons or entities deemed equivalent.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Once the legal limits are reached, the Directorate of Real Estate Affairs at the Ministry of Finance will take the necessary measures to suspend the registration of real property rights for non-Lebanese persons. These statistics will be published in the Official Gazette every six months.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">4.Development Obligation</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Property acquired by non-Lebanese must be developed or allocated for its intended purpose within five years of registration.

Lebanese Constitutional Council Position on Article One Amendment</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Constitutional Council Decision No. 2/2001, while issued over two decades ago, remains a cornerstone in understanding Lebanon?s property laws. The decision upheld the legal restrictions on property ownership by non-Lebanese, emphasizing Lebanon?s sovereign right to regulate land ownership in alignment with its constitutional principles, including the prohibition of settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Council affirmed that such restrictions do not violate Lebanon?s commitments to international human rights treaties, as they are based on legitimate public interest and national sovereignty. The decision highlights the critical importance of adhering to licensing and ownership limits, especially for foreign investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">C. A Final Note</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Investing in real estate in Lebanon requires navigating a complex legal framework.
