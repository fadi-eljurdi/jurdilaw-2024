THIS IS NOT A LEGAL ADVICE IN ANY FORM OR WAY.&nbsp;</u></p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO AUTHORISES RELEASE AND CENSORS CINEMATIC WORKS IN LEBANON?</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">According to Law 27/1947 and its subsequent amendments, all cinematic materials have to be examined and approved by the Lebanese General Security Authority ("GSA") before release, and regardless of where the motion picture is going to be released (cinemas and even private clubs). GSA examines all cinematic materials whether produced locally or internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">For imported cinematic materials, it is the responsibility of the Lebanese Customs Authority ("CA") to send the cinematic materials to the GSA in secured and sealed packages. Rejected films are returned to the CA, while the approved ones are retained by the GSA until the importer of the cinematic materials in question furnishes to the GSA proof of payment of applicable customs duty. Materials have to be submitted with the original film title, any subtitles and any translations thereof. It is not permissible to alter a film's title after SD's or the special committee?s approval (as the case may be).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The body responsible for censoring cinematic materials within the GSA is the Censorship Division ("SD"). The SD approves the films it deems in order for release and escalates those found to be non-compliant to a special governmental committee representing a number of concerned bodies (?Commitee?). If the Committee approves the film after censoring certain scenes/parts, the film is returned to its importer in its censored version (Copies of deleted parts are kept with the GSA and only returned to the importer for export of materials).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Criteria applied by the SD and the special committee includes a) conformity with public order, b) absence of any content inciting hatred or division, c) preserving the integrity of public authorities, and d) the rejection of all calls that are not in the interest of the state.</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">A censorship card will be attached to the approved-for-release film and shall include film title, publisher's name, number of sections, date of release approval, film registration number and approval for release as well as a censorship fee payment receipt (non-refundable unless a film is denied release).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Even following release approval, the minister of interior affairs enjoys the authority to ban a cinematic work in some or all territories of the Lebanese republic, following the GSA general secretary's recommendation, always subject to and in enforcement of applicable laws and regulations.</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Violating the above by any filmi importer, will result in monetary fines, the closure of the release venue up to 3 months, in addition to any applicable further punishments. Repetition will result in doubling fines and sentences.</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The question remains, how does this regulation respond to materials transferred through " Aspera" and the likes? A matter that we will address in future articles.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>?JURDI&amp;CO-2024&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>www.jurdilaw.com</p>
