                                <p>A pivotal committee of lawmakers within the European Parliament has granted approval to an unprecedented regulatory measure concerning artificial intelligence (AI), known as the European AI Act, thereby bringing it closer to the realm of enforceability. This momentous development signifies a significant milestone in the ongoing race among authorities to effectively manage AI, which continues to evolve at an astounding pace. Distinguished as the inaugural legislation for AI systems in the Western hemisphere, this Act assumes paramount importance. In a similar vein, it is worth noting that China has already formulated preliminary regulations intended to govern the development of generative AI products, including but not limited to ChatGPT.<br><br>The legislation adopts a risk-based approach to the regulation of AI, wherein the obligations imposed upon a system are commensurate with the level of risk it poses. Furthermore, the rules delineate specific requirements for providers of "foundation models," such as ChatGPT, which have garnered significant attention from regulators due to their escalating sophistication and the apprehension that even highly skilled workers may face displacement.<br><br>The AI Act systematically classifies AI applications into four distinct categories based on their associated level of risk: namely, unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and minimal or no risk. By default, applications deemed to pose an unacceptable risk are strictly prohibited from deployment within the European Union.<br><br>Unacceptable risk applications include AI systems that employ subliminal techniques or manipulative and deceptive strategies to distort behavior, exploit vulnerabilities of individuals or specific groups, employ biometric categorization systems predicated upon sensitive attributes or characteristics, enable social scoring or trustworthiness evaluations, facilitate risk assessments concerning the prediction of criminal or administrative offenses, engage in the creation or expansion of facial recognition databases via untargeted scraping, and infer emotions in the context of law enforcement, border management, the workplace, and education.<br><br>Numerous lawmakers have advocated for stringent measures to ensure that the scope of these regulations encompasses ChatGPT. Consequently, requirements have been imposed upon developers of foundation models, including extensive safety checks, data governance measures, and risk mitigations prior to the public release of their models. Moreover, they must ensure that the training data employed to inform their systems does not infringe upon copyright law.<br><br>It is important to underscore that, despite the endorsement of the legislation by European Parliament lawmakers, there remains a substantial journey ahead before it formally attains the status of law.<br><br>The impetus for such a regulatory framework stems from the rapid and largely unchecked advancement of AI technology by privately held companies, resulting in the emergence of systems like ChatGPT supported by notable entities such as Microsoft. Furthermore, prominent players like Google have recently unveiled a host of AI enhancements, including an advanced language model named PaLM 2, which the company asserts surpasses other leading systems in certain tasks.<br><br>The advent of innovative AI chatbots like ChatGPT has engendered widespread fascination among technologists and academics alike, owing to their ability to generate human-like responses based on substantial language models trained on copious amounts of data. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that AI technology has existed for several years and is currently integrated into numerous applications and systems, often unbeknownst to the general populace. For instance, AI algorithms determine the content displayed on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, shaping the viral videos and food images that populate users' feeds.<br><br>Will legistlators use AI to speed up their red tape policies!
