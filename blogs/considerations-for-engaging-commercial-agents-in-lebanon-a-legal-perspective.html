                                <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">Pursuant to Decree Law No. 34 dated August 5, 1967, the legal parameters governing commercial representation within the Lebanese jurisdiction have been carefully designed.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">For entities considering the appointment of a commercial agent within Lebanese territories, it is imperative to understand the stipulations enshrined in the aforementioned Decree. Notably, the Decree adopts a nationalistic tendency, conferring the privilege of conducting commercial agency operations exclusively upon Lebanese nationals. Should the agent be a Limited Liability Corporation or a Joint Stock Company, a mandate necessitates that Lebanese citizens retain a minimum of fifty-one percent of the capital shares. Concurrently, no less than fifty-one percent of the shareholder composition must comprise Lebanese nationals. With respect to the authority to execute documents on the corporation's behalf, only Lebanese nationals are equipped with this prerogative in both corporate structures. For the enforceability of the commercial agency contract against third parties, the Decree clealy mandates the formalization of said agreement in writing and its subsequent publication within the Commercial Register. Furthermore, for the proper registration of such a contract, the Ministry of Trade and Economy stipulates the submission of a time-stamped copy of the contract, enumerating the products encompassed therein. This document must undergo authentication, notarization, and subsequent legalization up to the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">Subsequent to the promulgation of Competition Law No. 281 in 2022, any exclusivity clause within a commercial agency agreement no longer precludes third parties from importing similar products or services into Lebanon, even if the aforementioned commercial agency contract adheres strictly to registration protocols. It remains binding upon service providers to ensure post-sale customer service and warranties, as mandated by the principal under the registered commercial agency contract, are duly furnished to customers. It is important to note that foodstuffs, pharmaceutical products, nutritional supplements, and medical provisions have been explicitly exempted from the purview of commercial agency agreements.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">Arising from this legal backdrop, pertinent inquiries emerge: Does the imposition of a geographically-constrained limitation on bestowing third parties with rights similar to those granted by a principal to an agent infringe upon the principles of Competition Law No. 281/22? Additionally, what are the legal implications if such a segment of the agreement fails to undergo the requisite registration?</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">By Lilian Abu Shahin&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); color: rgb(20, 33, 61);">LLB &amp; Legal Researcher</span></p><p><br></p>
