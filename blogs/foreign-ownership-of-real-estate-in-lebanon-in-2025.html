                            <aside class="article-aside">
                                <h1><strong>Foreign Ownership of Real Estate in Lebanon in 2025</strong></h1><p><br></p><p>Lebanon?s real estate market has attracted international investors for a long time. They seek opportunities in one of the Middle East?s most culturally rich countries.</p><p>However, strict legal regulations govern <a href="http://data.infopro.com.lb/file/Legal_Framework_for_Ownership_of_Land_in_Lebanon.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 109, 202);">foreigners buying property in Lebanon</a>. If you are not Lebanese and want to invest in real estate, it is important to understand the laws. This will help you follow the rules and protect your assets.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Legal Foundation: Decree No. 11614 and Law No. 296</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>The main legal reference for foreign property ownership in Lebanon is <a href="https://www.lexismiddleeast.com/law/Lebanon/Decree_11614_1969" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 109, 202);"><strong>Decree No. 11614</strong></a>. The authorities issued this decree on <strong>January 4, 1969</strong>. Law No. 296 changed it on <strong>April 3, 2001</strong>.</p><p>These laws explain how foreigners can buy property in Lebanon. They base themselves on Lebanon's constitutional principles. These principles include protecting national sovereignty and banning resettlement.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Real Estate Laws for Foreigners in Lebanon</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3>1. License Requirement</h3><p><br></p><p>1. License Requirement</p><p>Before purchasing property in Lebanon, foreigners must obtain a license from the Ministry of Finance. This license is essential as it grants permission to buy real estate.</p><p>The application process involves submitting various documents, including proof of identity and the intended use of the property. A good idea is to work with a<a href="https://jurdilaw.com/services/" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 109, 202);"> local lawyer</a>. You can rely on them to help you through this process and ensure that you complete all paperwork correctly.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Property Type Restrictions</p><p>Foreigners are allowed to buy property in Lebanon, but there are restrictions on the type and size of the property. For instance, non-Lebanese individuals can only purchase a maximum of 3,000 square meters of land. Additionally, certain areas may have specific regulations that limit foreign ownership, particularly in regions deemed sensitive for national security or cultural heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Investment Purpose</p><p>When applying for a license, you must specify the purpose of your investment. Whether you plan to use the property for residential, commercial, or tourism-related activities, this information is crucial. The authorities may prioritize applications that align with national interests, such as those that promote tourism or economic development.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Taxes and Fees</p><p>Investing in real estate in Lebanon comes with various taxes and fees. These may include property transfer taxes, registration fees, and annual property taxes. Budgeting for these costs is important, as they can significantly impact your overall investment. Consulting with a financial advisor familiar with Lebanese real estate can help you understand these obligations.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Legal Assistance</p><p>Navigating the legal landscape of real estate in Lebanon can be complex, especially for foreigners. I highly recommend hiring a local attorney who specializes in real estate law. They can help you understand your rights, negotiate contracts, and ensure compliance with all legal requirements. This support can be invaluable in avoiding potential pitfalls and ensuring a smooth transaction.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Market Research</p><p>Before making any investment, conducting thorough market research is essential. Knowing the local real estate market is important.</p><p>This includes property values, demand trends, and neighborhood dynamics. Understanding these factors will help you make better decisions. Engaging with local real estate agents can provide insights into the best areas for investment and potential growth opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>In conclusion, investing in real estate in Lebanon can be rewarding. However, it needs careful planning and following legal rules. To succeed and protect your investment, understand the laws, get professional help, and do thorough research.</p><p>Foreigners need to get <strong>approval from the Lebanese Council of Ministers</strong> before buying land or real estate. The Minister of Finance proposes the license and outlines case-by-case conditions in national laws.</p><p><br></p><h3>2. Restrictions on Certain Buyers</h3><p><br></p><p>Property acquisition is <strong>prohibited</strong> for:</p><ul><li>Stateless individuals are those not belonging to a recognized country.</li><li>Entities or individuals whose acquisitions violate the constitutional ban on permanent settlement in Lebanon.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>3. Ownership Limits by Area</h3><p><br></p><p>Foreign ownership is <strong>limited by law</strong> to:</p><ul><li><strong>3%</strong> of Lebanon?s total land area.</li><li><strong>10%</strong> of land in <strong>Beirut Governorate</strong>.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>These caps include companies deemed ?non-Lebanese? under Article 2 of Decree No. 11614. Exceptions apply for Lebanese-majority-owned companies with share transfer restrictions.</p><p>When the <strong>Council of Ministers</strong> reaches the limits, it may suspend further foreign acquisitions. The <strong>Ministry of Finance</strong> publishes statistics biannually in the <strong>Official Gazette</strong>.</p><p><br></p><h3>4. Development Obligation</h3><p><br></p><p>Foreign-owned property must be <strong>developed or used</strong> for its intended purpose within <strong>five years</strong> of acquisition. If not, the Ministry of Finance may <strong>reclaim</strong> or force the sale of the property.</p><p><br></p><h3>5. Licensing Exemptions</h3><p><br></p><p>No license is required in cases such as:</p><ul><li>Land <strong>under 3,000 sqm</strong> for construction.</li><li>Property acquired via <strong>inheritance</strong> or <strong>donations among heirs</strong>.</li><li>Specific rights like <strong>usufruct</strong>, <strong>mortgages</strong>, and <strong>leases</strong> (under regulated terms).</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Constitutional Council?s Position</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>In <strong>Decision No. 2/2001</strong>, Lebanon?s Constitutional Council confirmed that foreign ownership restrictions</p><ul><li>Are based on <strong>national sovereignty</strong> and <strong>public interest</strong>.</li><li>Do not contradict <strong>international human rights</strong> obligations.</li><li>Align with the constitutional ban on permanent resettlement.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This decision remains a guiding precedent, reinforcing the legitimacy of property laws restricting foreign ownership.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Legal Tips for Foreign Investors</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>If you're planning to invest in Lebanese real estate as a foreigner:</p><ul><li>Conduct <strong>property due diligence</strong> with a local legal expert.</li><li>Apply for the necessary <strong>license before purchase</strong>.</li><li>Avoid exceeding <strong>ownership thresholds</strong>.</li><li>Fulfill the <strong>5-year development requirement</strong>.</li><li>Ensure your company?s structure complies with <strong>local restrictions</strong>.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3>Can a foreigner buy property in Lebanon?</h3><p><br></p><p>Yes, they must get a license from the <strong>Council of Ministers</strong>.
