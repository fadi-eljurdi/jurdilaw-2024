The Law addresses artists (in our case performers), desiring to work in Lebanon in one of the "Artistic Professions" stipulated in the Law in consideration of a remuneration. Foreign artists must, for the purpose of obtaining a work permit, obtain from the Ministry of Culture (MoC) a certificate of reciprocity confirming that lebanese artists are receiving same treatment in the country which the artist is a national of, as well as a confirmation from the MoC presenting that this practice does not damage the interests of Lebanese artists.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, Article Two of the Directive 17561/1964 relating to the organising of foreign labour, presents that every foreigner desiring to enter to Lebanon for the purpose of working or performing a job (paid or not) is required to procure the approval of the Ministry of Labour (MoL), prior to the worker's/employee's arrival to Lebanon, unless he/she is an artist, then such approval shall be procured from the Lebanese Directorate of General Security.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Directorate of General Security conditions that foreign artists cannot enter to Lebanon for work, except with a prior ?artist? entry visa issued by the Artists Department and based on a request submitted to General Security by the inviting party (entity or person) specifying the date, duration and place of work, in accordance with the established procedures. Any person/entity interested in hiring a foreign artist ("Applicant") can apply for an expedited visa process to the Artists Department with the complete documents and the Artists' Department will conclude the visa process within a period of 48 hours.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">JURDI &amp; CO - 2024&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">www.jurdilaw.com </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
