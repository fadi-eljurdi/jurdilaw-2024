Publiclically referred to at the time as&nbsp; Lebanon Smoking Ban 2025, the Law was expected to be received with a lot of dissatisfied voices (people and traders) appearing to be a step in the right direction.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now with the beginning of 2025 and despite the challenges in the enforcement and the rise of heated tobacco and other emerging products (addressed partially by Decision 877/1 of 2015), Law No. 174 remains the primary legal framework governing tobacco promotion and advertising in Lebanon.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE RULES FOR PROMOTING &amp; ADVERTISING TOBACCO IN LEBANON?</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Article 9 of the Law on Advertising and Promotions of Tobacco Products stipulates that it is prohibited to advertise or place advertisements for a tobacco product, a tobacco product brand, or any related distinctive mark or trademark, except under the conditions and deadlines specified in the Law and its implementing decrees. It is also prohibited to manufacture, import, promote, sell, or display any goods of any kind that represent or suggest, in any form, a tobacco product, including but not limited to foods, sweets, candies, and toys, particularly for minors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, retailers, or distributors are prohibited from offering free gifts, in any form, to customers purchasing tobacco products or their derivatives.

Broadcasting or publishing any material, whether paid or unpaid, that promotes tobacco is strictly forbidden across visual, audio, print, and electronic platforms. Notably, there are no exceptions for portrayals deemed </span>&amp;#x22;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">organic to the story.</span>&amp;#x22;</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to </span><a href="https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/lebanon/advertising-promotion-sponsorship?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tobacco Control Laws Platform</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">:</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify">&amp;#x22;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although Law No. 174, effective March 2012, prohibits the broadcast of tobacco advertising and promotion, the law does not explicitly ban international or cross-border tobacco advertising on TV and radio. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the law bans international TV and radio advertising.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To align with </span><a href="https://fctc.who.int/news-and-resources/publications/i/item/9241591013" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">FCTC</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Article 13 and the FCTC Article 13 Guidelines, the law should clearly state that all international and cross-border tobacco advertising and promotion, including via international TV and radio, is prohibited.</span>&amp;#x22;</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This ambiguity extends to publications, leaving uncertainty about whether international newspapers and magazines featuring tobacco advertisements fall under the ban.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the currently very complex media landscape, international advertising often bypasses domestic jurisdictions, and without explicit bans, law enforcement bodies may struggle to hold foreign entities accountable. However, does the above call for a law amendment or it is primarily a question of enforceability?</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON OFFLINE TOBACCO ADVERTISING?</strong></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lebanese law imposes strict regulations on offline tobacco advertising:</span></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billboards, building roofs, store facades, and other public displays of tobacco advertisements are prohibited.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sponsorship of events, including cultural, sports, or commercial activities, by tobacco companies is strictly forbidden.</span></li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, retailers are allowed to display signage within their establishments indicating tobacco products are sold there.

With the rising popularity of tobacco amongst the younger generation, and youth tobacco use in Lebanon becoming a snowball of economic burden, Lebanon needs not only to find a quick solution to tobacco law enforcement challenges to tackle a phenomenon that is already </span><a href="https://www.economicsforhealth.org/files/research/898/emro-lebanon-rp-2022-final-am-mm.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">costing the Lebanese economy billions of dollars</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> desperately needed for the country?s economic development but also to issue further regulations, including but not limited to the imposing of a high excise tax. </span><span style="color: rgb(32, 49, 59);">The </span><a href="https://www.who.int/europe/activities/promoting-taxation-on-tobacco-products" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">World Health Organization recommends a minimum 75% tax share of the retail price of tobacco</a><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">, which </span><a href="https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/policy-fact-sheets/lebanon/summary" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Lebanon remains way below</a><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">.

Tobacco business being historically tied to politics and political decisions and with the potential emergence of better governance, law enforcement is expected to take precedence over other topics on the new government agenda. For that, businesses engaged in the tobacco business as well as others should stay tuned to upcoming changes in the legal landscape some of which impact the tobacco industry. With that in&nbsp; mind businesses should regularly review new decisions or updates related to legislations and regulations impacting the tobacco industry to ensure compliance and your business might need to adapt to future regulations on emerging products like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco.
